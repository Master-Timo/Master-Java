b) Assignment submission details.
c) Library books taken/returned in time.
d) What are the books taken from library before the exam.

2.  Create a package called Mathematics under your development directory called “MyApplication”.
Now create two packages “geometry” and “algebra” under Mathematics.

The geometry package contains classes like “Triangle” and “Rectangle”. 
Write proper data members, constructors and methods to compute any sort of manipulation 
relevant to the above classes [e.g. area(), perimeter(), etc.] . The algebra package contains 
a class called “TwoDEquation”. Write the class such that it must include a method that returns 
the largest +ve root for a given equation. Demonstrate the above program by importing both the 
packages assuming that your application is in “MyApplication” directory.
